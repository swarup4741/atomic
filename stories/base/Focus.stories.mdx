# Focus

Instead of your user's browser's native focus, you can make use of Atomic's. This is as simple as adding the `'focus'` class to your elements;
or using it in your classes `@apply` block.

All interactive elements in Atomic extend this classes styling.

## Overriding Color

To override the color of the focus ring, you can provide an appropriate [`ring-color` property from Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/ring-color).

For example, you can use the CSS below to turn all `btn` element's focus ring color to blue:

```css
.btn {
  @apply focus:ring-blue-400 active:focus:ring-blue-500;
}
```
