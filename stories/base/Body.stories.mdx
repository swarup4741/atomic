import { Meta, Story, Canvas } from '@storybook/addon-docs'

<Meta title="Base/Body" />

# Body

Atomic will style the `<body>` element in response to the presence or lack of the `'dark'` class.
This functionality is inline with [TailwindCSS' dark mode](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode).

> Use the "theme" control, found on the Toolbar (the picture icon), to toggle between *light* and *night* themes; the box below will change color in response.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Default" />
</Canvas>

To turn this functionality off, supply your own styling for the `body` and `body.dark` selectors.
The following will apply the `bg-gray-50` class to the `<body>` element, regardless of the current color-mode.

```css
@layer base {
  body, body.dark {
    @apply bg-gray-50;
  }
}
```
