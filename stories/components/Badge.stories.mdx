# Badge

The `'badge'` is a small, visual component that can help to distinguish information from surrounding elements.
This distinction is made without completely grabbing the user's attention, or can be used to highlight specific information the user may need time-and-time again.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Default">
    <span className="badge">Badge</span>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Size

The amount of `padding` surrounding the content of the badge can be controlled using the following classes:

* `badge-sm`
* `badge-md`
* `badge-lg`

By default, badges are sized to `badge-md`.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Small">
    <span className="badge badge-sm">Badge</span>
  </Story>
  <Story name="Medium">
    <span className="badge badge-md">Badge</span>
  </Story>
  <Story name="Large">
    <span className="badge badge-lg">Badge</span>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Color

`'badge-primary'` can be used to apply your configured primary color to the badge.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Primary">
    <span className="badge-primary">Primary</span>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

Additional colors can be added by overriding the default styles of the badge.

> The example below applies them inline, but extracting styles into a reusable class is recommended.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Custom Color">
    <span
      className="badge border-red-400 dark:border-red-600 bg-red-200 dark:bg-red-900 text-red-900 dark:text-red-50"
    >
      Danger
    </span>
  </Story>
</Canvas>
