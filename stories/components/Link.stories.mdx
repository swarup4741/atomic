# Link

The `'link'` component is one of the only components built with a specific element in mind: `<a>`.

That said, its styling does not in anyway form a dependency on this element - you are free to use this class on whatever element you so wish to.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Default">
    <a className="link" href="#">This is my link!</a>
  </Story>
</Canvas>
