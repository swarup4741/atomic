# Atomic

Atomic is a [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) [plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins) which provides styling for commonly encountered UI components.

It contains `base`, `component`, and `utility` classes which:

* Help to accelerate building a prototype application.
* Provide a sensible foundation on which to build an application's visual identity.
* Form a platform for implementating a consistent design accross many, seperate applications.

The rest of this introduction provides background on Atomic's guiding principles and instructions/cavets for using this [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

* Check out [Installation](?path=/story/documentation-installation--page) to get started using the library.
* The [Cookbook](?path=/story/documentation-cookbook--page) contains a collection of recipes for common workflows, pitfalls, and suggestions.
* Start [Extending Atomic](?path=/story/documentation-extending-atomic--page) to give your application an identity of its own.

## Principles

Atomic was created with the following principles in mind, fueled by my use of various design systems and implementations of component libraries
which follow those system's principles.

Many of the principles listed here blend with one another.

* **Reusable foundation** - Whether its quickly prototyping an idea or fulfilling the need for a consistent experience accross many code-bases, Atomic's styling favors reuse and promotes easy change at any point in an application's life - to meet the needs of *that* application.
* **Gets out of your way** - Atomic only provides *styling*. It purposefully does not include any JavaScript*, and isn't actually made up of components in the traditional, import-and-use-this-thing-in-this-way sense. You define the markup for your application and add Atomic's classes where you need them; [extending them](?path=/story/documentation-extending-atomic--page) if needed. Plus, Atomic's integration with [Tailwind's layer system](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives#layer) means styles you don't use are not included in your final CSS.
* **Framework agnostic** - Atomic does not rely upon any JavaScript framework, library, or tool - Tailwind excluded. This means it works wherever Tailwind works; [which includes quite a few places](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#integration-guides) ([VanillaJS](http://vanilla-js.com/) included).
  * This requirement on Tailwind is, like Tailwind itself, a development dependency. A production build with Atomic's styling is self-contained CSS.
* **Consistent** - Atomic has strong opinionations concerning the design of its styles - i.e., how it looks. Because styles are highly reusable, it's easy to build a component using parts of another and ensure consistency with a third, seemingly unrelated element.
* **It's not clingy** - Atomic is a collection of opinionated implmentations of Tailwind's utility classes, made using much of its [other functionality](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives). Want to drop Atomic and do-it-yourself using Tailwind? Go ahead! Thanks for stopping by! ❤️

\* - As a development-dependency, Atomic is JavaScript; this is how it's implemented as a [Tailwind plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins).
Once you build your CSS (using PostCSS, Tailwind's CLI, etc.), Atomic will only burden your application with CSS - just like Tailwind.

## Using Storybook

This [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) has been customized to act as Atomic's documentation.

> You can find a list of the addons and configuration used to create this Storybook [in Atomic's source-code](https://github.com/locktech/atomic).

As is with any Storybook:

* Use the **Toolbar** (at the top) to control global display options for all stories.
* The **Sidebar** (on the left) provides a quick way to navigate to any story.
* When in *Canvas* mode, the **Control** panel (on the bottom or right) provides a quick way to control the current story.
* When in *Docs* mode (the default), you will find useful information on how to make use of Atomic.

> The "Show Code" examples in this documentation are catered towards React - Storybook's default. Using them with any other framework/library should be as simple as replacing `className` with `class` or your framework's equivalent.
>
> `<button className="...">` would become `<button class="...">`
>
> These examples are also generated by Storybook; they may get lost in translation, so to say. A story's source-code can always be used for a more transparent example.
