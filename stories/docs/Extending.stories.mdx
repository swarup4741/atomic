# Extending Atomic

By design, Atomic's styling is easy and straight-forward to customize. This is due to the fact that all of its styles are built into [TailwindCSS' layer system](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives#layer)

This dependency on Tailwind's functionality makes this particular document only one-part extending Atomic, and one-part using [Tailwind's functions and directives](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives) to create custom classes.

## TailwindCSS Incorporation

It's recommended you incorporate your custom classes into Tailwind's layer system. This will ensure any stale-styles are [excluded](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/optimizing-for-production#removing-unused-css) from your final CSS.

It will also let you use your own classes with Tailwind's [`@apply`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives#apply) directive, promoting reuse.

## Simple Example

Atomic is just styling, behaving according to all the rules normal CSS would. To illustrate this, the most simple extension of Atomic's styling is to overwrite one of its classes' CSS.

```css
.btn {
  background: black;
}
```

The example above will set the `background` of all elements which use the `'btn'` class to black - retaining the other styles which Atomic has assigned to it; no Tailwind or other wizardry involved.

Just as easily, this CSS could have been written to take advantage of Tailwind's [`@apply`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives#apply) directive.

```css
.btn {
  @apply bg-black;
}
```

Or, to incorporate its styling into Tailwind's layer system:

```css
@layer components {
  .btn {
    @apply bg-black;
  }
}
```

This CSS can be loaded in whatever way you'd traditionally apply styling to your application.

* Load it globally.
* Apply it to only a specific element.
* ...

## Custom Button

Suppose that, in addition to the sizes provided by Atomic, you need an `xs` button:

```css
/* Recommended */

@layer utilities {
  .btn-xs {
    @apply px-1.5 py-0.5;
  }
}

/* Or */

.btn-xs {
  @apply px-1.5 py-0.5;
}

/* Or */

.btn-xs {
  padding: 0.125rem 0.25rem 0.125rem 0.25rem;
}
```

Using this size follows suit with use of Atomic's default button-sizes.

```html
<button class="btn btn-xs">Honey I shrunk the buttons</button>
```

By default, Atomic only includes two (three, counting disabled) colors for its button component.
Creating additional colors is a simple task: the way in which you define a custom color is the same way Atomic provides its `btn-primary` class.

We can even put this style right next to our `'btn-xs'` class.

```css
@layer utilities {
  .btn-xs {
    @apply px-1.5 py-0.5;
  }

  .btn-green {
    @apply btn;
    @apply bg-green-500 hover:bg-green-600 active:bg-green-700;
    @apply focus:ring-green-400 active:focus:ring-green-500;
    @apply text-gray-50;
  }
}

/* Equally valid */

.btn-xs {
  @apply px-1.5 py-0.5;
}

.btn-green {
  @apply btn;
  @apply bg-green-500 hover:bg-green-600 active:bg-green-700;
  @apply focus:ring-green-400 active:focus:ring-green-500;
  @apply text-gray-50;
}
```

The above snippet is accomplishing a few things:

1. It adds a new class, `'btn-green'`, to the `utilities` layer.
2. It extends the `'btn'` class; inheriting all of its styling - freeing the need to write `class="btn btn-green"` and making our intentions more clear.
3. It provides styles custom to the `'btn-green'` class, safely overriding the defaults of `'btn'`.

Using your new class is identical to using the `'btn'` class:

```html
<button class="btn-green btn-xs">Little green giant</button>
```
