# Extending Atomic

Atomic makes it easy to extend any of its classes styles, both globally and on a per-element basis.

Before explaining how to extend these classes, let's take a look at how the classes are structured.

Classes are organized into families. Each family can have `n` number of classes, with some having one and and others more.
Classes in the same family are always prefixed with the same name, all classes under `'input-*'` (including `'input'`) are in the input family.
Families can add classes to any three of Tailwind's layers.

Families are then organizied under a similar structure to Tailwind's layer system.
As a general rule of thumb, families found under the following categories have the following properties:

* **Base** - Are always added to Tailwind's base layer.
* **Components** - Add classes to all three, most of which only adding classes to `component`, of Tailwind's layers under the following rules:
  * `base` - Not applicible.
  * `components` - The default styling of the component.
  * `utilities` - Classes which augment the default styling, typically appearing alongside the `component` class.
* **Utilities** - Are always added to Tailwind's utilities layer.

> Because 2 out of 3 of the family-categories follow-suit with Tailwind's naming, the choice was made to keep the naming consistent.
> It also reinforces the visual perception of what these families provide:
> component-styling is in-line with what is considered a component, minus the functionality.

## Global Overrides

To override the styles for every instance of a class Atomic provides, add your styling over-top Atomic's in your own `@layer` definition:

```css
@layer components {
  .btn {
    @apply rounded-lg;
  }
}
```

Similarly, *Component* families can have additional styles added, taking the form of a component-variant:

```css
@layer utilities {
  .btn-red {
    @apply btn; /* btn is applied first, to overwrite its defaults */
    @apply bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-600 active:bg-red-700;
    @apply focus:ring-red-400 active:focus:ring-red-500;
    @apply text-gray-50;
  }
}
```

Using this class could look something like:

```html
<button class="btn btn-red">Button</button>
```

## Per-Element Overrides

Overriding a specific element is as easy as providing your own or Tailwind's classes *after* Atomic's.

```html
<button
  className="btn bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-600 active:bg-red-700 focus:ring-red-400 active:focus:ring-red-500 text-gray-50"
>
  Danger
</button>
```
