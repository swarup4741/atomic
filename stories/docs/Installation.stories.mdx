## 0) TailwindCSS

[Installing and configuring Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) is well out of this documentation's scope. How you go about doing this will be largely influenced by what framework or library you're using, or if you're even using one.

> **Atomic relies upon Tailwind v2.1 or higher.**

### 0.1) Setting up the JIT compiler

You should configure your installation of Tailwind to use the [JIT compiler](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/just-in-time-mode).
Creating a `purge` configuration which includes any files that will make use of Atomic's styling.

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  mode: 'jit',
  purge: [
    './src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,html,css}',
  ],
}
```

### 0.2) Theming

Atomic makes no opinionations about the colors it uses, outside of those described in [Color palette](#03-color-palette).

The theming which you *can* take advantage of is Tailwind's built-in support for detecting or toggling between [light and dark mode](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode).

You should enable dark mode in your `tailwind.config.js`, using whichever method is most appropriate for your project.

> The use of `light` and `night` themes is explained in later documents.

### 0.3) Colors

Atomic only makes assumptions that two colors will exist: `gray` and `primary`.

These colors should follow [Tailwind's lead](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#overview) and have 10 different shades; named as given in the link.

> `primary` was chosen to fit with what is commonly found in a design system or component library. See its [Cookbook entry](?path=/docs/documentation-cookbook--page#primary-color) for more information.

```js
// tailwind.config.js
const colors = require('tailwindcss/colors')

module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        gray: {
          50: '#F4F4F6',
          100: '#E5E5EB',
          200: '#C0C0CE',
          // ...
        },
        primary: colors.blue,
      }
    },
  },
}
```
