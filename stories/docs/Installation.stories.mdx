  * [As a Preset](#as-a-preset)
  * [As a Plugin](#as-a-plugin)

## TailwindCSS

[Installing TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) is out of this documentation's scope. This process will largely depend on the framework or library backing your application; or if one even is.

## Downloading

Download Atomic using your preferred package manager.

[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is shown below.

```bash
yarn add -D @locktech/atomic
```

If your installation of Tailwind does not have you installing the [`tailwindcss` package](), you'll need to do so.

```bash
yarn add -D tailwindcss
```

## Installing

Atomic must be included in your project's `tailwind.config.js` file.

There are two ways in which you may do this.

### As a Preset

Including Atomic as a [preset](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/presets) has the added benefit of including all configuration Atomic requires/recommends.

> You are still responsible for defining a [`purge` list](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/optimizing-for-production#removing-unused-css).

To do so, update your `tailwind.config.js` file to include:

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    require('@locktech/atomic'),
  ],
  purge: [
    './src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,html,css}',
  ],
  // ...
}
```

This will configure the following for your installation of Tailwind:

* Enable [dark-mode](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode) in [manual mode](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode#toggling-dark-mode-manually).
* Enable [JIT mode](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/just-in-time-mode).
* Load the Atomic plugin ([steps shown below](#as-a-plugin)).
* Provide defaults for Atomic's [required colors](?path=/docs/documentation-cookbook--page#color).

You can override any of these settings yourself, such as determining dark-mode based on the `prefers-color-scheme` media-feature.

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    require('@locktech/atomic/preset'),
  ],
  purge: [
    './src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,html,css}',
  ],
  darkMode: 'media',
  // ...
}
```

### As a Plugin

Using Atomic as a [plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins) provides the most control over your project, with zero side-effects from Atomic.

To do so, simply load Atomic as one of your project's plugins:

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    require('@locktech/atomic/plugin'),
  ],
  purge: [
    './src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,html,css}',
  ],
  // ...
}
```

You will then need to configure the following for your installation of Tailwind:

* Provide a `gray` and `primary` [color](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#custom-colors), following Tailwind's recommended structure (50, 100, 200, ...).

Optionally you may:

* Enable [dark-mode](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode).
