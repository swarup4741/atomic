## Don't use Atomic

You don't need it! [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) is a great framework to style your entire application with; no (additional) third-party nonsense required.

Only make use of this library if you read through the Introduction and thought "Wow! I (my team) really need(s) something like this!"

*Atomic is just a collection of classes*, built using Tailwind's utility classes. If you only need it for one application and can/want to dedicate the time
to creating that applications design yourself; do so using Tailwind on its own. Feel free to use Atomic's source for inspiration/reference; it'd mean just as much as actually using it!

So treat this library like any other library, this is your friendly reminder; just so you don't reimplement Atomic yourself while trying to use it :)

## Color

Atomic assumes that two colors will be present when Tailwind compiles your CSS: `gray` and `primary`.

* `Gray` is used in almost every class to provide shape, contrast, and other visual cues.
* `Primary` is used as a way for Atomic to have some notion of color outside of gray, and still remain ambigious to what color it actually is.

## HeadlessUI

[HeadlessUI](https://headlessui.dev/) provides functional, unstyled, highly-accessible components for [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/).
It pairs well with some of Atomic's classes, and is even used in this documentation by many of its examples.

HeadlessUI is the recommended approach for adding JS functionality to your application, which can be styled by Atomic's classes.
The two libraries should be a seamless integration.

## Applications

**Open Source**

* [Cerberus](https://github.com/LockTech/cerberus) - A multi-tenant account and permission management platform.

**Proprietary**

* n/a

## Examples

* [Atomic Example](https://github.com/LockTech/atomic-example) - A simple, `http-server` and HTML based example for using Atomic.

## LockTech's Colors

The colors used for this documentation (both the Storybook theme and in examples) are part of LockTech's branding - gray, in particular, is used accross all of our applications.

These are the colors provided by Atomic, when used as a [preset](?path=/docs/documentation-installation--page#as-a-preset).

If you are simply *in love*, feel free to use them in your own project(s)!

> These colors were generated using [niceramps](https://github.com/MathGeniusJodie/niceramps), a very nice tool made by GitHub user [MathGeniusJodie](https://github.com/MathGeniusJodie).
> They were then manually adjusted to provide a more pleasing contrast and to improve accessibility.
